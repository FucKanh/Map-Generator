How to use:
Use A & D or Left & Right Arrow to switch between maps
Press V if you would like to see the map being output to terminal
When changing the parameters, note that the wall thickness must be divisible by mapSize in order to get nicely fit images
Else, the float calculation would have significant errors when rounding
